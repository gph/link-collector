# Link Collector

The script will collect all links from a given URL, and if depth is greater than zero, it also collect the links of collected links and so on. So after they retrieve all links, it'll save the links and the datetime it was collected in a excel file (.xlsx).

PS: I did it for a job interview assignment.
